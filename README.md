# ChessViz Web App 

Welcome! This is a web app I created to learn about software development with Python and React.

I started playing chess a few years ago and I wanted to use my Data Science and Analytical skills to create a tool to help
both visualize data from a user's games but also gain some information which I felt is lacking on the main chess websites.

This is a work in progress but I plan to keep working on this project and add more features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later
- NodeJS v18.14.2 or later
- Optional: Have a chess.com profile, else it will default to my games dataset

## Setup & Installation


Install the Python packages needed for the backend:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the NodeJS packages needed for the frontend:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running The App

Start the backend with:

```bash
python viz_api.py
```

Navigate to /frontend/src and activate the frontend server:

```bash
npm start
```
